# Power-BI-healthcare-data-analysis-project
ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project in healthcare data analysis using Power BI!

The dataset is of past 4 years for both outpatient (patients who visit the hospital and leave the same day) and inpatient (patients who stay in the hospital for more than a day) scenarios.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Project Goals:
- Track Current Stats: Monitoring the patient waiting list for both outpatient and inpatient services.
- Historical Analysis: Analyzing the monthly trend of wait times for the past four years.
- Specialty-Level Insights: Diving deep into detailed specialty-level data to understand patterns and trends.

To ensure accuracy, I focused on both the average and median wait times. Since outliers can skew the average, calculating the median provided a more robust representation of the typical patient experience. 
By emphasizing the median, we can minimize the impact of extreme values and offer more reliable insights.

This project has been an excellent opportunity to apply data analytics to real-world healthcare challenges.
